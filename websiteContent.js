        In 2021, I worked as a Web Developer at Speedwave Event Sounds Rental, a top provider of audio-visual equipment for events. My role involved 
        boosting the company's online presence and expanding its market reach. I collaborated with management to understand offerings and audience, 
        then built a dynamic website to showcase our extensive services and equipment inventory. Challenges included designing a user-friendly 
        interface to highlight LED walls, speakers, stages, and more. I also took on Assistant Manager responsibilities, managing operational tasks 
        like quotations, emails, and customer interactions across platforms. Additionally, I handled administrative duties such as billing 
        statements and contracts, ensuring smooth transactions and compliance. As Assistant Manager, I coordinated with internal teams to fulfill 
        customer needs efficiently, fostering collaboration for exceptional results. My dual role demonstrated commitment, adaptability, and 
        leadership, contributing to business growth and customer satisfaction.
